## Overview

This assignment evaluates your skills with Laravel, Blade, Livewire, Alpine.js, Tailwind CSS, and object-oriented PHP. Each assignment builds on the same starter code, progressively increasing in complexity:

1. **Styling the Front End** – Enhance a provided unstyled Blade view with Tailwind CSS.
2. **Backend API Integration** – Create an object-oriented PHP service that interfaces with an external API.
3. **Livewire Component** – Implement a dynamic feature using Laravel Livewire (with Alpine.js support where needed).

## Project Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repo_url>
    cd laraweather
    ```

2. **Install Composer dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3. **Install NPM dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Compile assets:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev   # or npm run build
    ```

5. **Environment Setup:**
    - Copy the example environment file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    - Generate the application key:
        ```bash
        php artisan key:generate

5.5 **Database Setup**
`php artisan migrate --seed`

6. **Serve the application locally:**
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

7. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to see the unstyled starter page.

## Assignment 1: Styling the Front End with Tailwind CSS

**Objective:**  
Improve the provided Blade view(s) by incorporating Tailwind CSS to create a modern, responsive design.

**Tasks:**
- **Integrate Tailwind CSS:**  
  You may choose to add Tailwind via CDN (for quick setup) or integrate it into your build process using NPM and PostCSS.
  I actually used Laravel-native *vite* which may call these.
- **Style the Blade Template:**  
  Update `resources/views/welcome.blade.php` (and any other view if needed) to include:
  - A responsive navigation bar with a link to the application home and an external link to `https://google.com`.
  - A visually appealing content area. This is a weather dashboard. We know you are not a designer, but just provide the basics of a UI for a weather dashboard based off of your instincts.
  - A footer with social media icons and a copyright year 
  - Mobile-first responsive design adjustments
- **Accessibility & Design:**  
  Ensure that your design is accessible and follows best practices.

**Deliverable:**  
A styled front end that clearly demonstrates your proficiency with Tailwind CSS and demonstrates your approach to UI layout.

## Assignment 2: API Integration with Object-Oriented PHP

**Objective:**  
Implement an object-oriented PHP service that fetches weather data from a public API and integrate it into your styled dashboard.

**Tasks:**
- **Select an API:**  
  - Utilize the free forecast api at https://open-meteo.com/en/docs to create access to a weather API. This open source API provided up to 10K calls per day, which should be far more than needed to complete the project. 
- **Create a Service Class:**  
  - Create a new services directory in the application. 
  - Write an object-oriented PHP class (e.g., `ApiService.php`) that handles:
      - Making HTTP requests to the API.
      - Parsing the JSON response.
      - Handling potential errors gracefully.
- **Controller Integration:**  
  - Create a controller in the app to use your service class.
  - Pass the retrieved data to your Blade view from part 1 for rendering into the dashboard.
- **Best Practices:**  
  Use dependency injection and proper separation of concerns.

**Deliverable:**  
A working API integration that displays the parsed data on a web page.

## Assignment 3: Enhancing the Application with Livewire

**Objective:**  
Add a dynamic feature to the application using Laravel Livewire, demonstrating real-time interactivity without full page reloads.

**Tasks:**
- **Livewire Setup:**  
  - Install and configure Livewire in the project.
- **Develop a Livewire Component:**  
  - Create a Livewire component (e.g., `WeatherSearchComponent`) in the appropriate directory.
  - This component should include:
      - An input field (or dropdown) where users can enter or select a city.
      - A "Search" button (or live update as the user types) that triggers an action.
      - A loading indicator (optionally enhanced with Alpine.js) while data is being fetched.
- **Dynamic Data Fetching:**  
  - In the Livewire component's action method (e.g., searchCity), call your WeatherService to fetch the weather data for the entered city.
  - Update the component's properties with the new weather data.
  - Display the updated data in the component's view, replacing the default information.

- **Validation & Error Handling:**  
  - Validate the city input and display user-friendly error messages if needed.
  - Optionally, use Alpine.js for UI enhancements (like transitions or toggling between loading and results).

**Deliverable:**  
An interactive weather dashboard where users can enter a city name and see the page update in real time with the latest weather data from Open-Meteo, demonstrating your proficiency with Livewire and dynamic front-end integration
